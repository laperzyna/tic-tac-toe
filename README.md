## Description
This is a tic-tac-toe game coded in C. It is played within the terminal. It uses a 2D array to create the board and there are many areas where error checking is used. This program implements all of the basic rules of tic-tac-toe as well as determines a winner, loser, and draw. In this particular program minimax is used and therefore the computer will almost always win or draw with the user. The user will never win.

## Future Development
I hope to create an HTML/CSS page for this application so that it may be more visually appealing and more fun for users to play

## Process
I had so much fun coding this project. It's challenging yet fun, as I feel it usually is coding games especially games that are so well known. I hope to expand this program further.
